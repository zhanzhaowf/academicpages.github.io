Students who are interested in the following opportunities should contact Dr. Zhao (zhanzhao@hku.hk) with a CV and potential research ideas or proposals.

## Ph.D./M.Phil. Students
Dr. Zhan Zhao at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) is inviting prospective PhD/MPhil students who are interested in urban data science or related areas to join his research group. Potential research topics include, but not limited to, human mobility modeling, network science, shared mobility on demand systems, spatiotemporal data mining, social computing and urban AI. Strong candidates are expected to have
* passion for data-driven research for smart/sustainable/resilient/livable cities
*	familiarity with basic concepts and methods in at least one of the following areas: statistics, machine learning, optimization, or computer simulation
*	experience with scientific research and writing (publication records are preferable)
*	proven track record for academic excellence (highly-ranked universities with GPA > 3.6/4)

Students who are interested in pursuing full-time PhD/MPhil studies at HKU are encouraged to apply for a variety of scholarships. HKU and HK government offer very generous scholarship packages (up to around HK$400,000 per year) to top candidates. The application deadline is December 1, 2020. Those who are interested can find more information [here](https://www.gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees).

## Research Assistant (RA)
Part-time or full-time RA positions are available. The requirement for RA is similar to PhD/MPhil. Typically the contract is for 6 months to 1 year with potential for renewal. The position is well suited for students or junior scholars who are interested in accumulating research experience and pursuing a career in research.

## Post-Doctoral Fellow (PDF)
PDF opportunities are also available for highly qualified candidates (with PhD degrees). Strong technical skills (in machine learning, optimization, simulation, etc.), proven publication track records, and project management experience are preferred. Please contact Dr. Zhao for more details.
